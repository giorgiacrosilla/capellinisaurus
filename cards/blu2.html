                <p>The choices that you've made inside the experience set that you're an explorer! This means that
                    whenever you're visiting a country, you’re very curious and keen to do authentic experiences:
                    meeting the locals, immersing in their lives, and trying to understand social or political changes.
                </p>
                <p>You’ve chosen blue as the color that represents the experience the most. This means that you’re a very spiritual and sensitive person, you never have prejudices and so you’re always ready to embrace different cultures and ethnicities. Whenever you’re visiting a foreign country, you feel sympathetic with minorities or communities that are still discriminated. You are likely to take their side and support their legal and social rights.
