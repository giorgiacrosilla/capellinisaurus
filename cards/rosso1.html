                <p>The choices that you've made inside the experience set that you're an explorer! This means that
                    whenever you're visiting a country, you’re very curious and keen to do authentic experiences:
                    meeting the locals, immersing in their lives, and trying to understand social or political changes.
                </p>
                <p>You’ve chosen red and the political/social change: this means that you’re a very energetic person, focused on the present and constantly trying to change it for the better. 
                    Whenever you’re visiting a foreign country, you’re always looking at how locals live and ask them about their living conditions, problems and how the situation could be changed. 
                    You feel that not following touristic routes and making these authentic encounters can enrich your awareness and cultural experience.
