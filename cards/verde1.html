            <p>The choices that you've made inside the experience set that you're an explorer! This means that
                whenever you're visiting a country, you’re very curious and keen to do authentic experiences:
                meeting the locals, immersing in their lives, and trying to understand social or political changes.
            </p>
            <p>You’ve chosen green and the relationship between man and nature: this means that you’re very
                sensitive about nature, trying to live in a close contact with it, almost in a symbiotic way. You
                believe that since nature respects us, we need to respect it too and be careful about the choices
                that we make and that could alter this equilibrium.
                Whenever you’re visiting a country, you’re always searching for sustainable solutions, and you’re
                more interested in visiting small communities that still live an authentic life in nature than big
                cities.
